## Our Universe

### _The Creation of the Universe_

Most astronomers think that the Universe was formed during an event called the Big Bang - a giant explosion which occurred between 10 and 20 billion years ago. During the Big Bang, all of the space, time, matter, and energy in the Universe was created. This giant explosion hurled matter in all directions and caused space itself to expand. As the Universe cooled, the material in it combined to form galaxies, stars, and planets.

### _How big is the Universe?_

Nobody really knows how big the Universe is because we cannot see to the edge of it. We don't even know if it has an edge. We can only see out to a distance of about 14 billion light years from Earth. This means that the size of the Universe that we can see is about 28 billion light years in diameter. However, the size of the Universe is changing and gets larger with time.

### _How many galaxies are there in the Universe?_

Astronomers think that there are at least several billion galaxies in the Universe. The exact number is not known. 

### _Did you know?_

1. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth. That’s at least a billion trillion!
2. The universe has no centre and is constantly expanding (getting bigger) every second – making it impossible to reach the edge.
3. A black hole is created when big stars explode. Its gravitational force is so strong that nothing can escape from it – luckily the closest black hole is about 10,000 light-years from Earth.

### _Facts about Earth_

1. The Earth is about 4.5 billion years old – but that’s only a third of the age of the universe – which is 13.5 billion years old!
2. The Earth is tiny in comparison with the rest of the universe – it could fit into the sun 1.3 million times. 

### _Facts about other planets_

1. The moon is the reason why we have tides and waves on Earth. Along with the sun, it moves billions of tonnes of water each day.
2. A day on Mercury lasts longer than its year! Mercury moves around the sun faster than any other planet – making its year the equivalent of 88 Earth days. While a day on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days!
3. In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a ‘dwarf planet’ after 76 years classified as the outermost planet in our solar system since its discovery in 1930.

### _Interesting facts about our universe_

1. Distant galaxies are constantly moving further and further away from us as the universe expands.
2. Every galaxy in the universe is moving away from every other galaxy. There is no center to the universe.


### _What is the universe made of?_

1. Even though the Earth seems really big to us, it's actually a very tiny part of the universe. The Sun has a mass of 330,000 times the Earth. 
2. The Sun is just one star in the Milky Way galaxy that contains over 300 billion stars!
